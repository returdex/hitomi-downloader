## 📖 How to Use

1.  In `Search` tab search for keywords.
2.  Click the `Download` button directly on the comic card, or click the cover/title to go to the `Comic` tab, where you'll also find a `Download` button.
3.  After downloading, click the `Open Folder` button to check the results.

**By the way, you can export to PDF/CBZ(ZIP) in the `Local` tab.**

### Tag Translation in CBZ Export

When the interface language is set to `zh-CN`, the app translates comic tags written to `ComicInfo.xml` during CBZ export.

- Only CBZ metadata tags are translated. Internal app metadata and search tags remain unchanged.
- Unknown or unmapped tags fall back to the original tag text.
- The translation dictionary is based on [scooderic/exhentai-tags-chinese-translation](https://github.com/scooderic/exhentai-tags-chinese-translation), using [`dist/ehtags-cn.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scooderic/exhentai-tags-chinese-translation/master/dist/ehtags-cn.json).

## ⚠️ About Antivirus False Positives

For individually developed projects, this issue is almost unavoidable (~~because it requires purchasing a digital certificate for software signing, or even paying protection fees to antivirus companies~~).
The only solutions I can think of are:

2.  Trust my promise that everything you download from the [Release page](https://github.com/lanyeeee/hitomi-downloader/releases) is safe.
